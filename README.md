After cloning, make sure that the submodule has the latest source files. For that do the following: <br />
git submodule init <br />
git submodule update


In order to build the CMake project, here is one of the ways for example: <br />
mkdir build <br />
cd build <br />
cmake .. <br />
make


Type "help" in the terminal when the binary has started and you get the commands that can be sent to the chip.
